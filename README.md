# Discord Self-Bot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toucanee/.py-selfbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/toucanee/.py-selfbot)

### This whole bot is just for me to practice python and not for actual use. Discord does ban for these self-bots and I am not responsible for any bans.

### About
I made this just to practice python. Currently, it can only change your status to streaming, watching, ect. I will be adding new features, but no eta. I haven't added any ban prevention or anything to hide the fact of self-bot usage. You will probably get banned for using this.

My main bots are still going to be [Toucan-Bot](https://github.com/toucanee/toucanbotrevamp) and [Schedule-Chan](https://github.com/toucanee/Schedule-Chan). Please use those and not this.
